## Project aim
Aim of the project, what questions to be answered?

## Type of analyses

#### Basic analyses:
Steps? Order? Which softwares? Bottlenecks?


|Step #| Analysis  | Software  | Time  | Comment   |
|:----:|-----------|-----------|-------|-----------|
|1 |Metagenome assembly   |Megahit   |~6h (2 cores)   |-   |
|2 |Binning of assembly   |Metabat   |< 30 min (2 cores)  |-   |
|3 |Quality check of assembly and bins   |CheckM   |~2h (2 cores)   |-   |
|4 |Functional annotation   |Prokka   |~1h (2 cores)   |-   |
|5 |Basic phylogenetic placement of bins (Taxonomic ID)   |PhyloPhlan   |~6h (2 cores)   |-   |
|6 |Analyses of activity (expression level) of different bins   |?   |?   |-   |
